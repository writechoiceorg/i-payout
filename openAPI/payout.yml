      description: This API loads funds into customer accounts. You can submit an array of accounts in one API call. We suggest not to use more than 1000 accounts in one API call. With this API, if one record fails to load, then all the records in the API also will fail. You will need to resubmit all records in the API again once you fixed the failed record.
